    "One could ask the question how many pies does one usually eat on thanksgiving? Also which is the most popular type of pie? According to the data above roughly 89.4% of people do not buy an apple, pumpkin and pecan pies for Thanksgiving. I would imagine it would be useful to understand which pie is more popular overall and which pie is the least popular. \n",
    "\n",
    "The survey seems to draw a sample relatively proportional to the national population. At first the survey seems skewed to the 60+ age group. In fact according to [Age and Sex Composition in the United States: 2012](https://www.census.gov/population/age/data/2012comp.html) with similar age ranges, the percent of civilians noninstitutionalized looks like this:\n",
    "+ 20-29 = 13.9%\n",
    "+ 30-44 = 19.5%\n",
    "+ 45-59 = 20.8%\n",
    "+ 60+ = 19.2%\n",
    "\n",
    "The Thanksgiving survey looks like this:\n",
    "+ 18-29 = 19.54%\n",
    "+ 30-44 = 24.82%\n",
    "+ 45-59 = 28.41%\n",
    "+ 60+ = 27.24%\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the 60+ age group being 3% higher than the 30-44 age group in the Thanksgiving survey compared to the national population which the 30-44 age group is 3% higher, the survey seems to draw a sample relatively proportional to the national population.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also thought the sampled seemed skewed to the East Coast rather than the West Coast. The South Atlatic and Middle Atlantic Regions account for 37.38% of the samples, while the Pacific region including California only accounts for 13.96%. However when I looked at 2010 census data here [Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2016](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/2010-2016/state/totals/nst-est2016-01.xlsx) the samples sizes seem rather proportionate. According the 2010 census 15.4% of population lived in the states of California, Oregon and Washington. That is pretty close to the 13.96% sample size in this exercise. So it would appear that Pacific region is not underepresented. \n",

    "## Findings\n",
    "It seems like people who attending a \"Friendsgiving\" tend to be younger and have a lower income on average than those who don't. That could be because \"Friendsgiving\" is a new celebration celebrated by younger people. I personally have not heard about it until now. It could also be because older people work and have the income and means to to make it back to their hometown. \n",
    "\n",
    "It also seems like there is not a big difference between the average of income and who have tried to meet up with hometown friends and have never attended a \"Friendsgiving.\" This could mean income does influence if people can meet up friends in their hometown since a higher income could allow the respondent the means to make it back to their hometown.\n",
